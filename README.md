_Printf Project
Creating our printf function that produces output according to a format.

enter image description here

This repository includes our version of the printf function, the basic and main functions. Here we will apply the knowledge that we have acquired during the learning of the programming language C.
This project is requested by Holberton School.
Description
The printf function prints a format control string of different data types on the standard output, its roots are in the C programming language, it is a functional way to produce a precise output format for printing numerical values or ASCII characters from format specifiers that have been passed on in the argument.

Prototype
This _printf function produces output according to a format:

int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Formats
flag	function
%c	print a single character
%s	print a string
%d	print a integer as a signed decimal (base 10) number
%i	print same as "d", integer in base 10
Compilation
To compile a file with the function is necessary to add all the .c files involved in the program (functions, main files, etc). Your code will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o name_of_executable
To execute: ./name_of_executable
